## 🔧 API Integration

The frontend is designed to integrate with a Node.js + Express + Prisma backend:

- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login

### Loan Endpoints  
- `GET /api/loans` - Fetch marketplace loans

- `POST /api/loans` - Create loan request (borrowers)
- `POST /api/loans/:id/fund` - Fund a loan (lenders)

### Dashboard Endpoints
- `GET /api/dashboard/my-loans` - Borrower's loans
- `GET /api/dashboard/my-investments` - Lender's investments

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

## 🎮 Demo Mode

The app includes demo accounts for easy testing:

### Demo Accounts
- **Borrower**: demo-borrower@example.com / password123
- **Lender**: demo-lender@example.com / password123

### Demo Data
When backend is unavailable, the app uses mock data to demonstrate functionality.

## 🔐 Authentication

- JWT-based authentication

Trust levels: Low (🔴) | Medium (🟡) | High (🟢)

## 📱 Responsive Design
